## Picture directory from where it gets loaded
Here, the lottie files you upload get a new name and are automatically mapped to their questions.

If you delete a lottie file here, it won't be shown. However, do not delete it from here. Instead, use the website admin area because otherwise, it would still be in the database, but the lottie file wouldn't be found.
