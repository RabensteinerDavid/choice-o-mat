## Picture directory from where it gets loaded
Here, the pictures you upload get a new name and are automatically mapped to their questions.

If you delete a picture here, it won't be shown. However, do not delete it from here. Instead, use the website admin area because otherwise, it would still be in the database, but the picture wouldn't be found.
